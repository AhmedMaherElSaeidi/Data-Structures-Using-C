# Data Structures Implementation in C

## Overview
The goal is the implementation of data structures like stack, double-ended stack, queue, list, double linked list, and double sorted linked list using both array-based and linked list-based approaches.

## Implemented Data Structures:

1. **Stack**
   - Array-based
   - Linked list-based

2. **Double Ended Stack**
   - Array-based
   - Linked list-based

3. **Queue**
   - Array-based
   - Linked list-based

4. **List**
   - Array-based
   - Linked list-based

5. **Double Linked List**

6. **Double Sorted Linked List**
